IDARA was a project funded by the ESRC (Grant Number) that focused on using (1) machine learning tools for improving predictive modelling in the context of domestic abuse and (2) to develop a more nuanced understanding of patterns and trajectories of intimate parner violence using large bodies of police data. The project was a collaboration of criminologists (Prof. Juanjo Medina, Dr. Caroline Miles) with computer scientists (Prof. Gavin Brown), and police practitioners. Although the funding from the project has now come to an end the research team continues working on producing publications from this project.
